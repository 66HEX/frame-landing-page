		"section1": {
			"highlight": "Frame was born from a frustration with existing tools.",
			"text": "Media conversion shouldn't require a degree in video engineering or a command-line interface. We built Frame to be the tool we wanted to use: invisible when you don't need it, and incredibly powerful when you do. By leveraging Tauri and Rust, we've achieved a level of performance that feels native because it is native."
		},
		"section2": {
			"text": "This efficiency allows us to provide a seamless experience where the complexity of FFmpeg is tucked away behind a responsive, fluid interface. It means no more waiting for a bloated application to launch or struggling with non-standard UI patterns. Everything is optimized to get you from raw file to final output with as few clicks as possible, without sacrificing the precision that high-end transcoding requires."
		},
		"section3": {
			"highlight": "In an era where every utility seems to require an account, Frame stands apart.",
			"text": "It is strictly local-first software. Your media files never leave your device. There is no server-side processing, no telemetry that spies on your content, and no upload bars to watch. This architectural decision ensures not only absolute privacy but also maximum speed."
		},
		"section4": {
			"highlight": "Under the minimalist exterior lies the industry-standard FFmpeg engine.",
			"text": "Whether you're transcoding terabytes of raw footage for an archive or just compressing a quick screen recording, Frame adapts. It exposes the granular controls professionals need—bitrate, codecs, containers—without overwhelming casual users."
